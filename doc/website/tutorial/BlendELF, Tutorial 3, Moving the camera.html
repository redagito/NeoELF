<div class="topic">Tutorial 3, Moving the camera</div>
<div class="info">
This tutorial builds on the first tutorial, so be sure to do that first! <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120213051644/http://blendelf.com/tutorial1.html">[Tutorial 1, BlendELF Basics]</a>
<br>
<br>In this tutorial you will learn how to make a simple fly through camera</div>


<div class="topic">Step 1, WSAD</div>
<div class="info">
First we will modify the <b>init.lua</b> script file <b>main loop</b>. Here is how the <b>init.lua</b> script should look now:
</div>
<div class="codebox">scn = elf.LoadScene("level1.pak")
while elf.Run() == true do
end</div>
<div class="info">
<b>Hey! Whats that "scn" variable there before elf.LoadScene? I didn't see it in the first tutorial!</b>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, we didn't need it in the first tutorial. In addition to loading the scene, <b>elf.LoadScene</b> also returns a handle to the loaded scene so that we can access the objects in the scene with it.
<br>
<br>
So the first thing we have to do is to gain access to the currently active camera. Lets write a line that does that for us.
</div>
<div class="codebox">scn = elf.LoadScene("level1.pak")
cam = elf.GetSceneActiveCamera(scn)
while elf.Run() == true do
end</div>
<div class="info">
We pass the <b>scn</b> variable we just got from <b>elf.LoadScene</b> to <b>elf.GetSceneActiveCamera</b> to get the active camera in that particular scene.
<br>
<br>
So now we have our camera stored in the <b>cam</b> variable, what then? 
Well, now we will check on each frame (inside our while loop) if the 
user is pressing a certain button, and if he/she is, we will move the 
camera accordingly. Lets check for the <b>W</b> (we go forward with <b>W</b>) button first.
</div>
<div class="codebox">scn = elf.LoadScene("level1.pak")
cam = elf.GetSceneActiveCamera(scn)
while elf.Run() == true do
    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_W) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 0.0, 0.0, -12.0)
    end
end</div>
<div class="info">
The <b>elf.GetKeyState</b> function returns the current state of the key passed to it. In this case we pass <b>elf.KEY_W</b>, meaning the <b>W</b> key, to it. Here is a overview of the possible button states that <b>elf.GetKeyState</b> returns:
<ul>
<li><b>elf.UP</b> - the button is up</li>
<li><b>elf.PRESSED</b> - the button has been pressed on the current frame</li>
<li><b>elf.DOWN</b> - the buttons is being pressed but wasn't just pressed on the current frame</li>
<li><b>elf.RELEASED</b> - the buttons has been released on the current frame</li>
</ul>
So why do we have two states for a pressed button, <b>elf.PRESSED</b> and <b>elf.DOWN</b>? Basically when you press a button, its state changes to <b>elf.PRESSED</b> for the current frame. After that, if the button is still pressed, the state changes to <b>elf.DOWN</b>. The <b>elf.PRESSED</b> is useful if you want to, for example shoot a gun a single time. If you used <b>elf.DOWN</b> for that, you would be firing a bullet on every frame assuming that the button is still pressed. The <b>elf.DOWN</b> is useful for continuous movement. If you would use <b>elf.PRESSED</b> for that, your actor would move just for the instant the button is pressed and not when its down.
<br>
<br>
We use <b>elf.MoveActorLocal</b> to move our camera. The actor functions can be performed on any actor. That is <b>cameras</b>, <b>entities</b>, <b>lights</b> and <b>particles</b>. And what does <b>Local</b> stand for in <b>elf.MoveActorLocal</b>? That means that you are moving the actor according to its local orientation. For example, if you would use just <b>elf.MoveActor</b>,
 it would move according to the global x/y/z axises instead of moving 
according to the models local x/y/z axises. Yes, the three floating 
point values we pass to <b>elf.MoveActorLocal</b> represent the amount 
of movement in 3D space during one second. Since we are moving a camera,
 we want to move it locally every time we are moving it front, back, 
left or right. That being said, there are many situations where you will
 want to move an actor according to the global axises, and you will most
 likely know when to do that.
<br>
<br>
<b>Hey! Why are we moving the camera -12.0 to the Z direction, is that really moving to the front?</b>
<br>
<br>
Yes it is. Why is that? Well the camera coordinate system is different 
from the coordinate systems of other actors. For a camera, negative Z is
 front, positive Y is up and positive X is right. Just remember that and
 you are good to go ;). Also remember that this only applies when moving
 the camera locally. When you are moving the camera with <b>elf.MoveActor</b> or any other globally moving function, it works just like with other actors.
<br>
<br>
Try out the code so far, if it works right, it should make the camera go forward when you press <b>W</b>. If it doesn't work, please check the <b>console</b> or <b>elf.log</b> for errors.
<br>
<br>
Now, lets add the code for <b>S</b>, <b>A</b> and <b>D</b>.
</div>
<div class="codebox">elf.LoadScene("level1.pak")
cam = elf.GetSceneActiveCamera(scn)
while elf.Run() == true do
    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_W) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 0.0, 0.0, -12.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_S) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 0.0, 0.0, 12.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_A) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, -12.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_D) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 12.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    end
end</div>
<div class="info">
Again, go ahead and test your code. Be sure to test your code a lot and 
often. If it works, you should be able to move the camera forward, back,
 left and right. If the code doesn't work, check the <b>console</b> or <b>elf.log</b> for errors.
</div>
<div class="topic">Step 2, Rotating the camera with the mouse</div>
<div class="info">
Now we are ready to code the rotation for the camera. We are going for a
 classic flythrough camera, so you will be able to rotate the camera 
with the mouse.
<br>
<br>
But wait, what is needed for that? First we need to make sure that the 
mouse is inside the window all the time so that we don't get weird jumps
 in rotation while the mouse enters the window and goes out. We can do 
this by passing <b>true</b> to function <b>elf.HideMouse</b>. Also since now we can't close the window by clicking the <b>X</b>
 symbol in the top right corner of the window like you usually do to 
windows, we need an alternate way to close the window. Lets do that with
 the <b>ESC</b> key. You can also shut down BlendELF with the <b>F10</b> button on your keyboard, but it is nice to have some backup for it. Great! Lets add the code for this:
</div>
<div class="codebox"><span class="codered">elf.HideMouse(true)</span>
scn = elf.LoadScene("level1.pak")
cam = elf.GetSceneActiveCamera(scn)
while elf.Run() == true do

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_W) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 0.0, 0.0, -12.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_S) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 0.0, 0.0, 12.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_A) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, -12.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_D) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 12.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    end

<span class="codered">    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_ESC) == elf.PRESSED then</span>
<span class="codered">        elf.Quit()</span>
<span class="codered">    end</span>
end</div>
<div class="info">
For clarification, the new lines of code are marked in <span class="codered"><b>RED</b></span>.
 Now try to run the code and see if the mouse disappears and if the ESC 
button works. If not, don't worry, you can still close the window with <b>F10</b> or <b>ALT + F4</b> so that you can come back to fix your code.
<br>
<br>
So now we can move to camera rotation. For this, we need to know how 
much the mouse has moved during the current and the last frame. You 
could store the previous frames mouse position and calculate the 
differece between it and the current frames mouse position, but BlendELF
 already does this. You can access the difference with <b>elf.GetMouseForce</b>. The rest is just using the values we get from that:
</div>

<div class="codebox">elf.HideMouse(true)
elf.LoadScene("level1.pak")
while elf.Run() == true do
    cam = elf.GetSceneActiveCamera(scn)

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_W) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 0.0, 0.0, -12.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_S) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 0.0, 0.0, 12.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_A) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, -12.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    end

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_D) == elf.DOWN then
        elf.MoveActorLocal(cam, 12.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    end

<span class="codered">    mf = elf.GetMouseForce()</span>
<span class="codered">    elf.RotateActor(cam, 0.0, 0.0, -mf.x*10.0)</span>
<span class="codered">    elf.RotateActorLocal(cam, -mf.y*10.0, 0.0, 0.0)</span>

    if elf.GetKeyState(elf.KEY_ESC) == elf.PRESSED then
        elf.Quit()
    end
end</div>
<div class="info">
Because the mouse and 3d space coordinate systems are different, we use 
the negatives of the force as you can see. Also you can notice that we 
used just <b>elf.RotateActor</b> for the Z rotation instead of <b>elf.RotateActorLocal</b>.
 That is because unless you are writing a flight simulator, you don't 
want the camera to turn around Z according to its own orientation. That 
would make the user "stand tilted". You can try <b>elf.RotateActorLocal</b>
 on the Z rotation if you want to see the effect. Also keep in mind that
 the rotations we input are in degrees, not radians. Pretty much all 
rotation related functions in BlendELF use degrees.
<br>
<br>
If everything went right, you should be able to fly around the level now:
