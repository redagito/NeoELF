# NeoELF

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/faq9yhhcel6y2067/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/redagito/neoelf/branch/master)

A cross-platform 3d game engine based on BlendELF, written in C++ with a modern build system.

## Project Goal

Current goals are:
* Clean project structure
* Better / more documentation
* Organize doc, move content from old website to wiki
* Refactoring (mostly separating definition and implementation into separate files)
* Compile as C++ code
* CMake / Conan build system
* Achieve feature parity with last release of BlendELF (make sure everything still works)
* Setup Appveyor for automatic builds
* Unit tests
* Separate project into lib, app and tests
* Performance benchmarks
* Move to OOP based design
* Replace custom implementations of common functionality with std C++ counterparts (file system, string)
* Changes must show same or better performance
* Demos / games

## Building

Development is currently done with
* CMake, 3.16.0, https://cmake.org
* Conan, 1.25.0, https://conan.io
* Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition, https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community

Conan remotes used are
* conan-center: https://conan.bintray.com
* bincrafters: https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan

Building the project should just require running CMake and the respective build command.

## Project Status

Active development, no official release yet.
The project is currently not in a usable state.

## Screenshots

These are from BlendELF, to be replaced once everything works

## Original Readme

```
BlendELF is a work in progress, OpenGL graphics powered, compact
open source 3d game engine aimed towards independent game developers
for quick prototyping and game/virtual environment creation. It
