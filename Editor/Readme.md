By default, EditorELF opens an empty scene. All of the
functionality can be found in the property sidebar on the
right. It contains various submenus which enable you to
open and import scenes and files, edit various actor
types and preview the scene with post processing effects.
You can also drag objects to the scene from the left
sidebars file listing.
